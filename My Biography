My name is Pratham Tagad, and I am a first-year B.Tech student. My story is one of deep love, cherished memories, and unspoken emotions. It revolves around Raksha Shah, a fellow B.Tech student at Medicaps University, whom I have loved wholeheartedly for about three years. This is my journey—a tale of devotion, resilience, and unconditional love.

**A Fateful Encounter:**
It all began on May 26, 2022, a day that changed my life forever. I first saw Raksha at our coaching center. She walked in with a quiet grace, her presence captivating me instantly. Her smile, her laughter, and her kind demeanor left an indelible mark on my heart. I couldn't stop thinking about her from that moment onward.

On July 2, 2022, we had our first real conversation. It was brief, yet it remains etched in my memory. Months later, on December 27, 2022, we exchanged our first text messages. It was a simple beginning, but for me, it was profound and meaningful.

**The Beginnings of an Unseen Bond:**
Raksha’s aura brought light into my life. She became a muse, a guiding star in my darkest moments. Though we were not always in constant communication, every interaction—no matter how small—felt monumental. Her simplicity fascinated me, and I often found myself weaving stories in my mind, imagining a future where she played the central role.

**Special Memories:**
Over the years, I have built a treasure trove of memories with Raksha, each one etched deeply in my heart. Among these, our first drive together on August 5, 2024, stands out. That day was Raksha's JEE exam, and I had the privilege of accompanying her. It was a simple drive, yet it felt magical to me. I still remember the soft music playing in the background and how the world seemed to blur around us, leaving just her and me in focus.

I have saved countless pictures of Raksha, each one a snapshot of her vibrant personality and radiant smile. I also hold onto her voice notes, which I listen to whenever I miss her. Her voice is energetic, melodious, and comforting, like a song I never want to end. Her captivating black eyes are, in my words, "the most beautiful windows to her soul."

Her laughter, even now, echoes in my mind like a melody. It was infectious, uplifting, and sincere—the kind of laughter that could make even the gloomiest day feel sunny. Her small quirks, like the way she tilted her head when deep in thought or the way she blushed at compliments, made her even more endearing.

**Raksha's Personality and Charms:**
Raksha is a bundle of positivity and joy, a person who lights up every room she enters. She has a unique ability to motivate others, and she enjoys the simple pleasures of life—long drives, shopping sprees, chocolates, spicy food, and collecting bracelets. Her love for open hair and short nails adds to her charming individuality. Yet, she also has her dislikes, which include lies, fake compliments, medicines, milk, and heels. Her honesty and authenticity make her even more special to me.

Every interaction with her was a revelation of her depth. Raksha had dreams as vast as the sky. She once shared her aspiration of becoming a radio jockey and how that transformed into her ambition to excel in the IT field as a businesswoman. Her determination and focus inspired me and ignited my own dreams of success.

**Challenges in Our Relationship:**
My love for Raksha is deep and unwavering, but it remains unrequited. On October 14, 2024, I finally gathered the courage to express my feelings. My heartfelt proposal, however, was met with rejection. Raksha's response was firm: "Broo Listen Faltu baate nahi Varna mai baat nhi krugi And block bhi kar dungi So plss." These words, though painful, were a reflection of her boundaries and clarity.

Despite the heartbreak, I respected her decision and cherished the connection we still shared. However, on December 12, 2024, Raksha blocked me, leaving me devastated. The silence that followed was deafening, and the void it created in my life was immense.

The rejection did not diminish my love for her. If anything, it deepened my admiration. It takes strength to be honest, and Raksha’s clarity only reaffirmed her integrity. Though I was shattered, I chose to hold onto the memories and the lessons she brought into my life.

**My Unwavering Love:**
Even now, my love for Raksha remains steadfast. She is my favorite person and a source of inspiration, happiness, and hope. I dream of her success and wish for her happiness above all else, even if that happiness doesn’t include me.

I find solace in small things—her pictures, her voice notes, and the memories we shared. I often hide my pain behind a smile, choosing to celebrate her joys rather than dwell on my sorrows. To me, true love is selfless, and I am willing to wait a lifetime for her, even if it means loving her from afar.

**The Essence of My Story:**
This is my story—a tale of deep emotions and quiet sacrifices. It is a testament to the power of unconditional love and the strength it takes to let go. My journey is filled with moments of joy, pain, and resilience, each chapter shaped by my unwavering affection for Raksha.

In my eyes, Raksha is the most beautiful soul in the universe, a person who has left an everlasting impact on my life. While our story may not have the fairy-tale ending I hoped for, it serves as a poignant reminder that love, in its purest form, seeks only the happiness of the beloved. For me, Raksha’s happiness will always be my greatest treasure.

**Reflections and Hopes:**
Through this journey, I have learned the true meaning of love. It is not just about being together but about wanting the best for someone, even from a distance. I hope one day Raksha understands the depth of my feelings, not to change her mind but to know that she has been truly loved.

As I move forward in life, I carry Raksha’s essence with me. She is my muse, my motivation, and my reminder of what it means to be selfless. Whether our paths cross again or remain parallel, her presence in my life has been a gift, and for that, I will always be grateful.
